# Python lab from scratch

*A grab‑bag of procedural Python scripts written entirely from scratch — no frameworks, just raw code and curiosity.*

---

## ✨ Why this repo?

This repository showcases my hands‑on experimentation with the fundamentals of Python. Each script was implemented “by hand” to deepen understanding of algorithms, recursion, testing and general problem‑solving.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.10
* [pytest](https://pytest.org/) (only needed to run the automated tests)

Everything else uses only the Python Standard Library (`re`, `typing`, etc.).

> ⚠️ **IDLE users:** the integrated shell cannot run `pytest` directly. Run the command above from your terminal (PowerShell, Bash, CMD) or use an IDE that integrates pytest (e.g. VS Code, PyCharm).
